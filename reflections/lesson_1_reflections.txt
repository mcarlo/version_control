How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff helped me spot the bug quicker because it highlighted the 
differences. Knowing that one script worked meant whatever was the same wasn't 
the problem

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I might waste less time finding earlier versions of my code if I make a 
mistake

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing it manually means I can control what constitutes a change. 
Auto-saved versions might simply have a few minimal changes plus a time 
difference

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git seems arranged to help a developer consider a version in the context of 
its environment at the time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To help me find when/where I made some specific change(s)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will know I can always return to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Working on projects piecemeal
